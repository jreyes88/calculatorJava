# calculatorJava
My very first Java Project.

Inspiration and direction in this was found on GamesAndCodeVX YouTube channel, beginning with this video: https://youtu.be/bXq5sGWPQpM

##About this Calculator
It's a basic calculator application with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It also has a negative value button, decimal, and backspace buttons.

This was a fun project, took about two and a half hours total, and was a great intro to Java and the Eclipse IDE.
